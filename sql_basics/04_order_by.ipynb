When browsing the options for different codes, you might restrict yourself to codes that are reported by many countries.\n\nWrite a query below that selects the indicator code and indicator name for all codes with at least 175 rows in the year 2016.\n\nRequirements:\n- You should have one row for each indicator code.\n- The columns in your results should be called `indicator_code`, `indicator_name`, and `num_rows`.\n- Only select codes with 175 or more rows in the raw database (exactly 175 rows would be included).\n- To get both the `indicator_code` and `indicator_name` in your resulting DataFrame, you need to include both in your **SELECT** statement (in addition to a **COUNT()** aggregation). This requires you to include both in your **GROUP BY** clause.\n- Order from results most frequent to least frequent.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code goes here\ncode_count_query =\"\"\"\nSELECT indicator_code, indicator_name, COUNT(1) AS num_rows \nFROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`\nWHERE year = 2016\nGROUP BY indicator_code,indicator_name\nHAVING num_rows >= 175\nORDER BY num_rows DESC\n\"\"\"\n\n# Set up the query\nsafe_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(maximum_bytes_billed=10**10)\ncode_count_query_job = client.query(code_count_query, job_config=safe_config)\n\n# API request -
